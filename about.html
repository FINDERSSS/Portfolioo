      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        My name is "Greek_Jeff". I am a low-poly 3D modeler specializing in creating assets for Roblox games using Blender.
        <br><br>
        With 5 months of experience, I have developed a strong understanding of the unique challenges and opportunities of creating low-poly models for Roblox.
        <br><br>
        I have worked on a variety of projects, including modeling characters, accessories, and environment assets for Roblox games.
        <br><br>
        My goal is to create high-quality, optimized models that bring Roblox games to life. I am constantly learning and improving my skills in Blender and Roblox, and I am always open to new challenges and opportunities.
        <br><br>
        If you're looking for a reliable and skilled low-poly modeler to help bring your Roblox game to life, I'd love to hear from you.
